## Project Title: Let’s Get Woke Saint Louis

## Description:<br />  
Our project is to describe each zip code in Saint Louis and provide an overview of their economies and demographics. We will compile and analyze multiple data sources and let the data show what is unique about each zip code.

## 3-5 Initial Research Questions:
* What is unique about each zip code located within the Saint Louis city limits?
* How do the zip codes (neighborhoods) compare by a number of demographic variables using descriptive statistics?
* If you were moving to Saint Louis and were new to the area, which is the most attractive zip code to live and why?

## Data Shortcomings:
Each of our datat sources have different availability as far as by zip code or neighborhood. For time variables, we sometimes only have limitied information. For historical data, we will try to get 5 years of data (August 2013 until July 2018). If 5 years is not available, we will use as much as is available.
